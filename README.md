# Challenge X

## Description

 The Team Profile Generator was created by using Node.js which will prompt the user for information about their employees. The user can input any number of team members, and their information based on their roles. This assignment also has unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
